# Blackjack strategy tester

This app is designed to test a specific blackjack strategy. It loads a strategy file from the `assets` directory, simulates rounds with random cards, provides possible actions for a given hand, allows the user to select an action, validates the choice, and tracks scores. The app only simulates the first stage of a round and does not handle bets.
